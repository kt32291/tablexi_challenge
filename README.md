# TableXI Menu Challenge

## Instructions

To find the food combinations you can afford with Katie's Badass Menu Calculator, clone this repo. Navigate into the directory and run:

```ruby tablexi_challenge.rb```

It will prompt you to enter the path to your menu file, and output your results! (Two test files are included right in the repo - 'test.txt', 'test2.txt')

Happy Eating :)
